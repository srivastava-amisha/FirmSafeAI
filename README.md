This repository hosts the code implementation of the research presented in the paper "Hardware-based Detection of Malicious Firmware Modification in Microgrids". 

Overview
FirmSafeAI is a cybersecurity tool designed specifically for microgrid applications. It integrates custom-built Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) with Time Series Classifiers (TSCs) to detect and mitigate firmware modification attacks on Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Boards and other critical components within microgrid setups. This innovative approach, part of the Design-for-Security (DfS) paradigm, aims to enhance the resilience of microgrids against cyber threats, thereby safeguarding critical energy infrastructure.

Key Features
Custom-built HPCs: Leverage detailed performance metrics from hardware components to monitor and assess operational integrity.
Time Series Classifiers: Analyze patterns over time to detect anomalies and potential threats.
High Accuracy: Demonstrated effectiveness in experimental setups, achieving up to 100% accuracy in identifying firmware modifications.
Targeted for Microgrids: Specifically tailored to address the unique security challenges of microgrid systems.
